CODE:

- json input
- all filters should be able to read either a string or a dict
- flush outputs when input is dead, bug with celery logs on this
- ZuluDateFilter does not handle failure.  should it just return None if
  it cannot convert?
- FileWatcher needs to have a reverse for multiline_regex

DOCS:
 

TESTS:
- try py.test
- adeza vim plugin (https://github.com/alfredodeza/pytest.vim)

EXPLORE:

  * failed to get a virtualenv running with pypy.  pyzmq_static would not
    compile properly under pypy
- using mlt in searching for similar records in solr
