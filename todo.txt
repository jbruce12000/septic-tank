CODE:

- json input
- all filters should be able to read either a string or a dict
- flush outputs when input is dead, bug with celery logs on this
- ZuluDateFilter does not handle failure.  should it just return None if
  it cannot convert?
- FileWatcher needs to have a reverse for multiline_regex

DOCS:
 

TESTS:
- try py.test
- adeza vim plugin (https://github.com/alfredodeza/pytest.vim)

EXPLORE:
- using ZMQ to split work among multiple workers
  - maybe use ZMQ pipeline model
  - maybe use multiprocessing module
- add url shortener - like bitly
- pypy - might be a huge speed improvement for the centralized processor
  * failed to get a virtualenv running with pypy.  pyzmq_static would not
    compile properly under pypy
  * works using pyzmq-ctypes (this needs to be added to requirements if I get it to work)

- using mlt in searching for similar records in solr
- inotify, apt-get inotify-tools
