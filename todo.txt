CODE:

- include a "path" field type in solr so that faceting on path parts happens automagically - solr.PathHierarchyTokenizerFactory
- json input
- rabbitmq input (vince not a fan)
- multiline input, or make current input multiline
  could make it an aggregator that just goes after the input to aggregate
  lines.

- need hostname, environment (OTIS,PROD) included in each record
- need a reversegrep filter to remove records based on one or more fields
- crashes when solr is not reachable
- zmq needs to have timeout/retries on server side
