Got a shitload of logs? Septic Tank might be the tool for you.

Septic Tank is a pipeline based data processor.  It is written in python, is fast, and has a low memory footprint. Each pipe in a pipeline has a very specific function.  Pipes may be put together in a pipeline in any way you like.  

Getting Started 

  git clone git://github.com/jbruce12000/septic-tank.git
  cd septic-tank
  virtualenv vseptic_tank
  source vseptic_tank/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  cd septic_tank/
  ./make_sample_log.py | ./parse_sample_log.py |more


Inputs

Filters / Parsers

Warnings
